This project, titled "Automated License Plate Recognition Using OpenCV" involves multiple integrated systems with each component performing specific functions within its scope. We utilized the capabilities of OpenCV for image processing and EasyOCR for optical character recognition to develop this project. 
The key objectives include:
•	Implementing image processing techniques for detecting and segmenting license plates from video frames.
•	Displaying detected license plates and processed images on the screen using pixel coordinates.
•	Applying edge detection algorithms to enhance image clarity and improve recognition accuracy.
•	Utilizing OCR for extracting alphanumeric characters from segmented license plate images.
This system aims to automate the recognition process, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in applications such as traffic monitoring and law enforcement. The project explores various methodologies for image processing, including grayscale conversion, noise reduction, and contour detection, integrated with character recognition for real-time plate identification.
